Emergency Compliment!
=====================

This is a [Sinatra Application](http://emergency-compliments.herokuapp.com/) based off of the original [Emergency Compliment](http://emergencycompliment.com/#). 

This version includes sessions, so that the same message and gif do not appear consecutively when the user refreshes the page. If you are interested in the use of sessions, this is a [blog post](http://blurredcommandlines.tumblr.com/post/70411849058/enlightened-lightening-talk) I wrote with Chris Haack on the matter.

I hope you enjoy the compliments, and if you wish to see more, they are available [here.](http://peoplearenice.blogspot.com/p/compliment-list.html) Thanks!
