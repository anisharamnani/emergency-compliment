If I freeze, it's not a computer virus.  I was just stunned by your beauty.
You make my data circuits skip a beat.
You get an A+!
I heard you make really good French Toast.
You're cooler than Pirates and Ninjas combined.
You are quite strapping.
Your cooking reminds me of my mother's.
I disagree with anyone who disagrees with you.
You have perfect bone structure.
I am utterly disarmed by your wit.
I can tell that we are gonna be friends.
You could survive a zombie apocalypse.
Even my cat likes you.
You could invent words and people would use them.
You don't need make-up, make-up needs you.
You make me want to frolic in a field.
I love the way you click.
I would love to visit you, but I live on the Internet.
When I grow up, I want to be just like you.
I would trust you to pick out a pet fish for me.
Our awkward silences aren't even awkward.
I appreciate all of your opinions.
I love what you've done with the place.
You are like a spring flower; beautiful and vivacious.
That looks nice on you.
You have a good taste in websites.
Your mouse told me that you have very soft hands.
You are full of youth.
You have a good web-surfing stance.
Way to go!
